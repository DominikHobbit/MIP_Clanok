abstract = {During recent years "gamification" has gained significant attention among practitioners and game scholars. However, the current understanding of gamification has been solely based on the act of adding systemic game elements into services. In this paper, we propose a new definition for gamification, which emphases the experiential nature of games and gamification, instead of the systemic understanding. Furthermore, we tie this definition to theory from service marketing because majority of gamification implementations aim towards goals of marketing, which brings to the discussion the notion of how customer / user is always ultimately the creator of value. Since now, the main venue for academic discussion on gamification has mainly been the HCI community. We find it relevant both for industry practitioners as well as for academics to study how gamification can fit in the body of knowledge of existing service literature because the goals and the means of gamification and marketing have a significant overlap.},

abstract="Gamification has increasingly been applied to various life domains and environments, including work and the workplace. Accordingly, research on gamification has grown considerably in the past years. This study presents a systematic review of the theoretical and empirical literature produced in the past 11 years about the application of gamification to the work domain. We analyze the available literature about why gamification is important in work and human resources management, how it can be guided, and which are the examples of gamification in this domain. The systematic review was based on 35 articles, including theoretical papers, empirical (quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods) studies, case studies, and other types of papers (presentation of new resources for gamification). Findings are summarized in terms of the sample, country of the study, study type, main results, and gamification and work dimensions associated. The results show that research on the applications of gamification in the workplace is scarce and mostly exploratory. Most studies were conducted using quantitative methods, but with small samples and simple research designs. Although the literature suggests evidence for the usefulness and appropriateness of gamification in the workplace, there are significant limitations in the research, translating a gap between HR practitioners' concerns and academic developments in this field.",

abstract="Gamification---taking game design patterns and principles out of video games to apply them in non-game environments has become a popular idea in the last 4 years. It has also successfully been applied to workplace environments, but it still remains unclear how employees really feel about the introduction of a gamified system. We address this matter by comparing the employees' subjective perception of gamification with their actual usage behavior in an enterprise application software. As a result of the experiment, we find there is a strong relationship visible. Following up on this observation, we pose the gamification design problem under the assumptions that (i) gamification consists of various types of users that experience game design elements differently; and (ii) gamification is deployed in order to achieve some goals in the broadest sense, as the problem of assigning each user a game design element that maximizes their expected contribution to achieve these goals. We show that this problem can be reduced to a statistical learning problem and suggest matrix factorization as one solution when user interaction data is given. The hypothesis is that predictive models as intelligent tools for supporting users in decision-making may have the potential to support the design process in gamification.",

In its November 2012 press release, Gartner predicts that ``by 2015, 40{\%} of Global 1000 organizations will use gamification as the primary mechanism to transform business operations''. In the same report, they also predict that ``by 2014, 80{\%} of current gamified applications will fail to meet business objectives, primarily due to poor design''.",
